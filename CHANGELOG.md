RDFa bookmarklet style overhaul, HTTPS support, escape key shortcut to close
summary view, and new bookmarklet for small inspecting RDFa sections within the
page context.

- As a metadata expert, I want to view a readable RDFa summary so that I can
  clearly distinguish different sections and repeated attributes in the data.
- As a metadata expert, I want to close the RDFa summary with a keyboard
  shortcut so I don't have to scroll all the way to the top to close the RDFa
  information panel on pages with a lot of metadata.
- As a metadata expert, I want to view a summary of RDFa content on secure
  (HTTPS) pages so that I can see the information without forcing my browser
  to load insecure content.
- As a metadata expert, I want to view individual sections of RDFa content so
  that I can inspect the RDFa generated alongside the content.
